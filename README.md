# brightnessControl

This was the final project for my Applied Software class in 2018. 
It involved LEDs that adjusted themselves based on the brightness of the environment. 
In darkness, the LEDs will brighten, and in light, the LEDs will dim.

The second component of this project graphs data from the Photoresistor in real time, an implementation of my other project https://github.com/wmmcguire/RealTimeData 

## Skills acquired
</br>• Graphing Live Data with Matplotlib
</br>• Sensor testing
</br>• Electrical Circuitry controlled with Python
